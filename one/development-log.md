 #Development Log  (2.07.19)


Wrote most of the program to a  level im happy with and this is my first development log.
At this point I’m looking at ways of adding small improvements to the code to include extra features. 

I have an issue where if you talk in the cli it double prints and looks ugly so I’m thinking of getting rid of the entire cli as a chat interface (so it’s only needed to start the program)


I’m currently adding a kick command so that I can selectively kick users from the server and if I get the chance I’d like to add a votekick command for users as well as an option to change their text colour (but that may be too troublesome)
